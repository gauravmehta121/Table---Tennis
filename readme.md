 Table Tennis
This web app allows you to check if the table tennis table in your residence hall lounge is free or not.

How does it work?
When you select the hall from the dropdown menu or you use voice recognition to input the same, it takes a picture with your webcam and sends it to Microsoft's Cognitive Services API which then returns tags like "playing","people","net","racket","table","ball" and hence we conclude that the table tennis court isn't free!
